# Recommendation-Systems
Building recommendation systems in Python:

SIMPLE RECOMMENDATION MODEL:

The simple recommenders are basic systems that recommend the top items based on a certain metric or score. Here, we will build a simple recommendation model for movie database.
The dataset files contain data about 45,000+ movies listed.
This dataset captures some features like cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts, and vote averages 


CONTENT-BASED RECOMMENDATION MODEL:

In this coding scheme, will learn how to build a recommendation model that suggests movies that are similar to a particular movie based upon some content provided.
For the dataset provided, there is a content in the 'overview' feature, which is explaining about the movie in textual formatted data in about 20-to-30 words.
In simple words, we calculate the similarity matrix & which will help us to know the very similar movies for a given input movie title.
