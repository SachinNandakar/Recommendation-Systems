# Recommendation-Systems
Building recommendation system in Python:

The simple recommenders are basic systems that recommend the top items based on a certain metric or score. Here, we will build a simple recommendation model for movie database.
The dataset files contain data about 45,000+ movies listed.
This dataset captures some features like cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts, and vote averages
